***** Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets *****

Chapter Number: 1
Chapter Number: The Worst Birthday
Chapter Summary: 
All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top of the line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.
Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.
He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:  “Happy birthday to me… happy birthday to me…”  No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist.
For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him.
“Remember, boy—one sound—”  Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.

Chapter Number: 2
Chapter Number: Dobby's Warning
Chapter Summary: 
But, sir”—Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper—“there are powers Dumbledore doesn’t… powers no decent wizard…”  And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps.
Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!”  “Quick!
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry… Dobby hoped… if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him… Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir…”  Harry wasn’t listening.
There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunias pudding.
The cat flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room.

Chapter Number: 3
Chapter Number: The Burrow
Chapter Summary: 
Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side.
Draco Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy…  “I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf…” said Harry.
“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, “like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods…”  There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up.
“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if—er—he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth… There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find… As long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t—”  “Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.
Very pleased to meet you, Ron’s told us so much about—”  “Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.

Chapter Number: 4
Chapter Number: At Flourish and Blotts
Chapter Summary: 
“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly—”  “He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss,” said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder, too.
Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass—and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through.
Your son has fine taste, sir.”  “I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant—”  “Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for—”  “It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco.
Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be Harry Potter?”  The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to the front.

Chapter Number: 5
Chapter Number: The Whomping Willow
Chapter Summary: 
When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.
Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?”  “Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up.
With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground.
“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.
Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight.

Chapter Number: 6
Chapter Number: Gilderoy Lockhart
Chapter Summary: 
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.
“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house—”  Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!”  “What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him.
The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan club.”  When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell.
They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.

Chapter Number: 7
Chapter Number: Mudbloods and Murmurs
Chapter Summary: 
“But I’ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape.”  “I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.”  “You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted.
“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me—come in, come in—thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again—”  Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the oneroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other.
“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin.
“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them—you know—a bit o’ help—”  Harry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin.
Harry let Lockhart’s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.”  The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him.

Chapter Number: 8
Chapter Number: The Deathday Party
Chapter Summary: 
The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces.
They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.
Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.
The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.
From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.

Chapter Number: 9
Chapter Number: The Writing on the Wall
Chapter Summary: 
Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework.
After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.”  Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.
“I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore—”  “But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn’t—” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.
He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that…  But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin!
The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message “The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.”  “That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron muttered.

Chapter Number: 10
Chapter Number: The Rogue Bludger
Chapter Summary: 
“But the thing is, it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it—I’m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow acting venoms…”  “Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!” said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her.
Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.
Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again.
He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood…  A whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.
“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s bed out of sight.

Chapter Number: 11
Chapter Number: The Duelling Club
Chapter Summary: 
“I hope Ron’s not in another girls’ toilet…”  Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called “Gather round, gather round!
“When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents—only to disarm them—we don’t want any accidents—one… two… three—”  Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a saucepan.
“Finite Incantatem!” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.
Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?”  “Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear him.

Chapter Number: 12
Chapter Number: The Polyjuice Potion
Chapter Summary: 
Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through…”  Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.
They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle.
Harry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe’s into the last one.
Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had hoped.

Chapter Number: 13
Chapter Number: The Very Secret Diary
Chapter Summary: 
“We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.
This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing, “His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.
His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.
Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!”  The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.

Chapter Number: 14
Chapter Number: Cornelius Fudge
Chapter Summary: 
They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.
Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.
There will be no more evening activities.”  The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence.
They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves.
At this rate, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.”  “Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking alarmed, “Dumbledore suspended—no, no—last thing we want just now…”  “The appointment—or suspension—of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy smoothly.

Chapter Number: 15
Chapter Number: Aragog
Chapter Summary: 
McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in…”  Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat and cauldron.
Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.
They’ve taken him to Azkaban.”  Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.
Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.
They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak.

Chapter Number: 16
Chapter Number: The Chamber of Secrets
Chapter Summary: 
“The first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.”  “I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.
I’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls…”  Ron suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.
Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, “Expelliarmus!”  Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.
“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, “any sign of movement, close your eyes right away…”  But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull.
“I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body—say good bye to your memories!”  He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, “Obliviate!”  The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb.

Chapter Number: 17
Chapter Number: The Heir of Slytherin
Chapter Summary: 
“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently  “And that—” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, “that’s the old school Sorting Hat—”  So it was.
Let’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him…”  He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away.
Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’ wing sweep his cheek as he took flight.
Then he heard Riddle’s hissing voice:  “Kill him.”  The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor.
“You hold Ginny’s other hand—”  Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers.

Chapter Number: 18
Chapter Number: Dobby's Reward
Chapter Summary: 
“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering.
Everyone thought I was Slytherin’s heir for a while… because I can speak Parseltongue…”  “You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort—who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin—can speak Parseltongue.
“If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.”  Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s desk, picked up the blood stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry.
Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and—killing Muggle-borns… Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves.
